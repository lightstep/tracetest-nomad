# tracetest-nomad

The purpose of this project is to provide Nomad Jobspec equivalents of the [Tracetest Helm charts](https://github.com/kubeshop/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/tracetest).

The ultimate goal is to have this as a Nomad Pack, and ultimately add to the [HashiCorp Community Pack Registry](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-pack-community-registry).

As of the time of this writing, the rendered Helm template YAMLs have been converted to their Nomad jobspec equivalents. Check out the full details [here](jobspec/README.md).
